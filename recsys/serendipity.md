Serendipity

#### Unexpectedness
Unexpected set is items generated by recsys / items generated by primitive prediction  model

Unexpected recs may not always be useful.
u(RS\PM) to describe usefulness of unexpected recs
When u(RSi) = 1, RSi is useful. u(RSi) = 0, 

When we found unexpectedness and usefulness
can calculate serendipty by taking the sum of u(RRi) / NDCG

If a user likes action movies
- add a documentary
  - Doesn't comply with his interests. if he like it, documentary are valuable seredipitous
